## About Me

Hi! I'm Ayush. I'm a Linux Systems Administrator and a DevOps enthusiast.

I've created projects like

- [tessen][1]
- [kangae][2]
- [pass-coffin][3]
- [pass-tessen][4]

I like to write a [wiki][5] to learn and remember the things that I learn. I also write my thoughts
in my [microblog][6]. My dotfiles are available in [this repository][7].
